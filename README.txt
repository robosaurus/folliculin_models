This project is for modelling folliculin with each aa (in turn) deleted.
Later we will score the structures with cartesian fastrelax, and use
this as a measure for how well the deletions are tolerrated.

First up is the sequence generation. Versions of the FLCN fragment sequence  
with single AA deletions. This is done with sequence_generator.py
